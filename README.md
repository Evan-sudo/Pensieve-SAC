# Pensieve SAC

## About Pensive-SAC

This is a TensorFlow implementation of Pensieve[1]. 
We trained Pensieve via state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, i.e., SAC.
It's a stable version, which has already prepared the training set and the test set, and you can run the repo easily: just type

```
python train.py
```

instead. Results will be evaluated on the test set (from HSDPA) every 300 epochs.
